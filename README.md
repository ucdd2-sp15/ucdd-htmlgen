# Install

Install dependencies. There is only one so far, which is [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug), a small but very popular debugging utility.

	$ npm install

# Test

Run 'test.js' which contains a series of function calls to all the library functions defined in 'lib.js'.

	$ DEBUG=* node test.js

The DEBUG=* prefix turns on all debugging messages.

# Development

Many of the functions in 'lib.js' have not been implemented yet. Make a fork and start implementing them. Once you are done, commit your implementation and make a pull request.
